NGINX has been a strong part of this movement from its inception. As the internet has grown, so have we, from our
initial web server to the myriad of projects involving JavaScript, Kubernetes, API gateways, OpenTelemetry, and
WebAssembly.

NGINX is committed to open source both in ethos and practicality, aiming to deliver reliable and cutting-edge
technology within a healthy open source culture. Whether NGINX is part of your open source past or a step in your
present, we welcome you into the future together.

Together we can power the future.

We believe that healthy communities are core to innovation and open source sustainability.
It is our mission to enable the NGINX community to engage with and develop solutions based on open
and available NGINX technologies.

Our community is your entry into an open world of information, collaboration, and discussion. Thanks for joining us.
