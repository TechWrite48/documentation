{{< page-section title="Vulnerability Reporting" >}}
We appreciate your assistance in identifying and reporting bugs or security vulnerabilities in our projects. Your
feedback helps us maintain the quality and security of NGINX open source projects.

Methods to report a vulnerability will vary per project.

{{< page-section title="Reporting via GitHub" >}}

Some projects such as [NGINX Core](https://github.com/nginx/) use GitHub to manage vulnerabilities.

[Report a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
directly within the open source project repository. We are using the GitHub workflow that allows
us to manage vulnerabilities in a private manner and to interact with reporters securely.

**Steps to report via GitHub:**

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Select “Security” in the repository navigation bar
3. Select the “Report a vulnerability” button. If this button is not visible, then GitHub reporting is not enabled for
   the project. In that case, please report via email.
4. Fill in the required details, including a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or
   logs.
5. Submit

The F5 Security Incident Response Team (F5 SIRT) has an email alias that makes it easy to report potential security
vulnerabilities:
    
* If you’re an F5 customer with an active support contract, please contact F5 Technical Support.
* If you aren’t an F5 customer, please report any potential or current instances of security vulnerabilities with any 
NGINX open source project to the F5 Security Incident Response Team at F5SIRT@f5.com.
